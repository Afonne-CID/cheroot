The packaging metadata has been migrated to the
:file:`pyproject.toml`-based :pep:`621` declaration
-- by :user:`jaraco` and :user:`webknjaz`.

As a part of this update, the minimum version of the
``setuptools`` build backend was bumped to 61.2.
Moreover, any compatibility shims that existed in
:file:`setup.cfg` and :file:`setup.py` have been
removed for good.
