The test infrastructure has been updated to stop using
the ``pytest-forked`` plugin
-- by :user:`jaraco` and :user:`webknjaz`.

This plugin was causing problems with upgrading to modern
versions of Pytest and it is not going to be fixed anytime
soon.

It was used in a test that interacts with the system
resource limits under \*NIX environments in hopes to isolate
the side effects caused by the preparatory code.

It is possible that this will have an effect on the test
sessions and we may have to look for alternative solutions
for test process isolation.
